"Analyser" not "Analyzer" (because the Web Audio node is named like so) but Equalizer! (AE preferred)
grep for comments like //... (Things not yet properly done or polished)


BOOT PROCESS
============
index.html   Made to load quickly and show a spash screen. Errors while initializing are shown to the user
boot.js      Prepares the browser so the actual application can start (Audio autoplay, unhandled rejections)
main.js      The actual Earwiggle Music Player


FILES
=====
index.html
constants.js                 SETTINGS and DEBUG

helpers.js

music_library.js
song_data.js

music/                        Music files (mp3, ogg, ...)
test/                         Noise and sine sweep files (wav, ogg)


MODE OF OPERATION
=================

Timeouts and requestAnimationFrame
----------------------------------
When the player is paused, updates are skipped in setTimout loops. Browser consume some CPU still, occasionally.
timestamp  "High" presicion setTimout(, 10) loop: ontimeupdate only fires ca. 3 times per second
starfield  Quick'n'dirty addition, <iframe>. I added some pause control to it, requestAnimationFrame loop
analyser   requestAnimationFrame loop
waveform   requestAnimationFrame loop

Hardcoded Icons
---------------
PNG for items matching [data-trigger] hardcoded to allow floating icons for the Local File album and playlist entries,
normally, *.jpg is assumed.


DEBUG
=====
ENABLE: Call the page with ?debug
Or run your local server as harald.ist.neu using /etc/hosts, then debug is opt-out and ?debug disables
- Test sounds added to playlist
- console.log()s enabled
- "Global" objects in  window.{PLAYER,EQ,WIGGLE_REJECT}


TODO
====
[ ] Lyrics missing in middle layout; Show and move down 100vh, so the user needs to scroll one page down
[ ] Zoom 2 columns with advanced controls:  Scroll playlist should also scroll page (when from bottom up)
[?] Albums: Drag instead of mousewheel - what about eq sliders
[ ] Tab-index: Start at stop button (So user can tab once and start playing)
[E] show_source.php: Lightmode in <iframe> not working (viator)
[ ] Dragon's Vow: "... not far from the fight"
[ ] Upload entry breaks playlist continuation
[ ] Re-nest player markup, use grid with display:contents
[E] MYSTERY MARGIN: .controls needs overflow:hidden, or it adds horizontal margin to the player, when small layout
[ ] EQ: Shift+Right click = reset all
[\] Loop Song: Only auto-skip, buttons allow next song
[ ] Player Phone Mode: Main controls fixed to top
[ ] Waveform click: Modes (oscillogram, animated, 5 zoom steps)
[ ] <picture> multiple resols, update the script
[!] Dict visibilities for sections
[E] data-trigger="undefined" (found in inspector)
[ ] Playlist manager: skip upload/triggers
[ ] iframe.starfield: fade in correctly when new song starts, manage fading
[ ] Albums: Drag with mouse-scroll
[E] Middle click does not reaset EQ
[ ] Click on playing song in playlist: pause/resume
[ ] toggle lyrics via class, remove <h2>Lyrics</h2> when none
[ ] Now Playing + Cover + Comment: min 100vh
[ ] Hide lowest row in .controls when .simple
[ ] <a> colors same as bootscreen colors
[!] Need to click Stop to halt animations on start, should be able to start disabled and toggle willingly,
    same as rAF updates with uninitialized canvases, sound should reconnect anytime
[!] Filter: "artist:Hjalvandar"
[!] Waveform: Cache waves (RAM)

[?] Button and inputs make sound
[ ] Fade on play/seek/skip
[ ] Move CSS vars from :root to .audio_player
[ ] Scales for volume slider (soft, mid, loud)
[ ] Pause on inactivity: (Option) Halt everything when not in focus
[ ] Filter: Buttons Filter, All Songs illuminated
[ ] Check all property introducers (this.thing; below const self = this)
[ ] Global rAF manager: Checks visibility before calling registered render functions
[ ] Global rAF manager: is_canvas_sized
[ ] span.timestamp -> <time>
[#] Get rid of WIGGLE_REJECT
[ ] body.initializing - not going away - providing text-align:Center to albums
[ ] Extra padding/margin for focus outline creates issues
[ ] Move variables to .audio_player (keep them private to us), rename --player-* (--player-items too specific)
[ ] Controls: Play button when nothing yet selected starts first visible
[#} When Local Files clicked, remain until album clicked, and use filter for local only
[#] Local Files: remove icon
[ ] Save settings: Don't do in modules, only when main exits
[?] Integrate starfield
[E] Playlist not looping, ends: Stop not pressed
[E] Custom range inputs on iOS not working
[ ] Albumlist: Top div artist:*, bottom album:*
[ ] Dragdrop reorder playlist

[E] Albumlist: Not updating when new albums added (upload)
[!] Albumlist: Filter according to term, show something for not matches
[E] Albumlist/Playlist: Album selected needs to scroll into view when on full list (filter celeared) clicked
[E] Albumlist/Playlist: Album selected with playing song needs to select the song
[E] Pause while Stopped
[#] Playlist progresses, "clicks" album (focus for 200ms) without changing filter results
[#] Enter "clicks" items, analyser; Cursor keys for seek on waveform (tabindex)
[ ] Cursor keys unused axis: focus next element, or change grid section (album <-> filter <-> playlist
[*] Filter also selects/focuses album
[*] Current album:brighter/thicker border
[ ] Adding local files does not add an album
[!] Tabindex + Focus
